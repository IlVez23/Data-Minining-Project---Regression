# Data Minining Project
 
This repository contains the notebook and files for a university based project for regression of popularity for songs released on Spotify.

the task itself is restrained to using a regression rather than a classification using multiple popularity ranges. 
That is set by default by the faculty, but it could be an option for further implementations.
